    <h2>Project Description</h2>
    <p>
      This vehicle was custom-built to carry children with mobility limitations. It's powered by two 18V drill batteries in parallel, supplying a single 18V system with extended runtime.
      The dual ESCs control both the drive motors and the steering system independently.
    </p>

    <h2>Tools & Components</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 × 18V Power Tool Batteries (wired in parallel)</li>
      <li>Hobbywing QuicRun 880 Dual-Motor ESC (rear motors)</li>
      <li>Radiolink CL9030 ESC (steering motor)</li>
      <li>RC Transmitter + Physical Pedal Control</li>
      <li>Servo disconnect system for manual/RC control switch</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Status</h2>
    <p>
      The vehicle works reliably and is capable of supporting over upto 500 lbs. It features a automatic kill switch for the parent, disconnectable shaft and hot swappable batterites
    </p>

    <h2>Next Steps</h2>
    <p>
      The next step is to design a cleaner control interface by fully removing the old "computer" unit that previously managed shifting. I’m also planning to add a screen mount and night lights for visibility, along with a detachable hitch.
      I'm currently exploring more compact ESC options and a modular mounting solution for the electronics inside the body.
